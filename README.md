Many a times we write code snippets to try out some new technology, to solve a computational problem, or to write an efficient implementation of an existing algorithm. However most of us fail to keep track of such code snippets so, we end up re-inventing the wheel (or rather the code) whenever we are faced with a similar programming challenge. Ofcourse, with the abundance of open source code available on the web, it only takes a few clicks to download what you are looking for. But I found that it is much easier to refer to one's own piece of code. Here I have managed to collate some of the software programs that I wrote as part of my graduate and undergraduate course work. Some of these are solutions to fairly complex problems and some of them can be readily reusable. Please feel free to download and modify them as per your need, and do send in your feedback. I have categorized them according to the programming languages used, just to make it a bit easier to browse.
